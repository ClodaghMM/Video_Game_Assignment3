# Video_Game_Assignment3
Repo for Assignment 3 of intro to video game development

This repository stores the code, images and mp3 files for Assignment 3 and 4 as a part of Intro to Video Game Development course taken in Spring Semester of 2021. 
This project overall achieved 75% with some functionalities yet to be developed. 

The brief was to create a game inspired by pac-man and incoporate similar characters, level design, sounds, music and theme. 

Due to the heavy inspiration used by this, this game will not be released to the market. Rather it was used as a learning opportunity for future video game projects.
